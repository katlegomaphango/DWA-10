# DWA_10.3 Challenge 1

## Description

In this module, you will be required to use the [Shoelace component library](https://shoelace.style/) in a brand-new JavaScript project and build the original [Tally Count App](https://tallycount.app/) example from the very first lesson using only Shoelace components. You will be provided with three user stories that should be met at a minimum, however, you are encouraged to add additional functionality. You are free to choose the components you think are best suited to meet these user stories. Be mindful to examine all components and read the documentation thoroughly before proceeding.

### You are required to resolve the following User Stories (expressed in Gherkin syntax).

- SCENARIO: Increment the counter by one
  - GIVEN the tally counter app is open
  - AND the counter is at 0
  - WHEN I click the "Add" button
  - THEN the counter should display 1

- SCENARIO: Decrement the counter by one
  - GIVEN the tally counter app is open
  - AND the counter is at 1
  - WHEN I click the "Subtract" button
  - THEN the counter should display 0
 

- SCENARIO: Resetting the Tally Counter
  - GIVEN the tally counter app is open
  - AND the counter value is 10
  - WHEN I click on the "Reset" button
  - THEN the counter value should change to 0
  - AND a confirmation message should be displayed that the counter has been reset
